  { subject: "Curious about your background", body: "Hi, I came across your work and was wondering how you first got into painting. Formal training or self-taught?" },
  { subject: "Your art gives off a dreamlike tone", body: "Hey, I really like that surreal atmosphere in your pieces. Do you consciously chase that mood or let it happen?" },
  { subject: "Your line work caught my eye", body: "Hi, your control over line and form is impressive. Do you sketch a lot before starting a new piece?" },
  { subject: "Loved your use of negative space", body: "Hey, just wanted to say that your balance of detail and emptiness in your last work is really engaging. Do you plan that balance or feel it out as you go?" },

  { subject: "Curious about your process", body: "Hey there, when you start a new piece, do you already know what you want it to look like, or does it change along the way?" },
  { subject: "Your work feels very modern", body: "Hi, your latest series reminds me of contemporary European art styles. Do you follow any current artists?" },

  { subject: "Your contrast of realism and abstraction", body: "Hey, your style seems to balance the two beautifully. Do you lean toward one more personally?" },
  { subject: "Curious about your creative flow", body: "Hi, do you usually work on multiple pieces at once or one at a time?" },
  { subject: "Your recent post drew me in", body: "Hey, saw your post earlier and really liked the atmosphere in it. How long did that one take to finish?" },
  { subject: "Your tone reminds me of classical work", body: "Hi, your last few pieces feel almost renaissance-inspired. Do you study older painters?" },
  { subject: "That blue you used was stunning", body: "Hey there, random note — that shade of blue in your last painting really worked. Do you mix your own colors?" },
  { subject: "The depth in your portraits", body: "Hi, your portraits carry so much subtle expression. How do you decide when a piece feels finished?" },
  { subject: "Your art feels very balanced", body: "Hey, I like how your work manages to be calm and powerful at once. Do you usually paint in silence or with music?" },
  { subject: "Loved your use of minimalism", body: "Hi, your simplicity really speaks volumes. Do you find it harder to simplify or to add?" },
  { subject: "Your compositions feel musical", body: "Hey, weird question — do you listen to anything specific while creating? Your pieces almost feel rhythmic." },
  { subject: "Do you sell your pieces directly?", body: "Hi, just curious — do you usually handle sales yourself or through a platform?" },
  { subject: "Your new piece felt powerful", body: "Hey there, that recent post really drew me in. How long have you been developing this current style?" }
